# Enquiry-Handling

The FCO's Enquiry Handling product replaces email addresses published on GOV.UK with an enquiry form hosted on Microsoft Dynamics custom portal. 

The files contained in this repository are the, client-side javascript and associated resources used to apply GOV.UK styles to the form. 

This is the public facing part of the solution. We also use Dynamics with our Contact Centre teams to more quickly and efficiently handle enquiries that are received.
